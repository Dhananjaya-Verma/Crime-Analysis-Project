Crime Analysis Project

How We Implemented:-

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Source: [Specify the source of your crime data, e.g., government datasets, police reports, etc.]
Cleaning and Transformation:
   - Handling missing values
   - Normalizing data
   - Feature engineering (if applicable)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots)
   - Statistical analysis (correlation, distribution analysis)

Model Selection and Training:

Algorithm Choice: [Explain the rationale for your chosen algorithm, e.g., K-Means clustering, Decision Trees, Neural Networks]
Model Training:
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

Deployment (Optional):

Platform: [Specify the platform used, e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud]
Deployment Steps: [Outline the steps involved in deploying the model]

Data Insights:-

Key Findings:
   - [Summarize the most significant insights from your analysis, e.g., crime hotspots, trends over time, correlations between factors]
Visualizations:
   - [Include relevant visualizations to support your findings, e.g., maps, charts]
Limitations:
   - [Discuss any limitations or biases in the data or analysis]

How We Implemented
We collected crime data from the [Data Source] and preprocessed it to handle missing values and outliers. We employed K-Means clustering to identify crime hotspots and used a Decision Tree classifier to predict the likelihood of crime occurrence based on various factors. The model was trained and evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation technique.
